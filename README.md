# A virtuous flood for the architectural project


My project in Ile de France in the town of Villeneuve Saint George is located on a flood zone between la Seine and the train "RER". So why not turn this factor into a strong point for our project?
So, how can we build quality homes that are resilient and safe, but above all that blend harmoniously into the local urban fabric?

We worked in groups to respond to requests from the town hall, which wanted new housing and new schools. Our action is based around three sites linked to green / public spaces.

Originally a super market occupies the ground where I work. Today, my program includes collective housing, a commercial space with a hall and a shared garden. I want to ensure the safety of residents and practitioners of the site. The objective of the project is to be able to maintain an economic activity and a local practice 365 days a year. My project will then be practicable as much in floods as in sunny days.

I decided to integrate common areas in heights such as a shared garden or a common footbridge thanks to the environmental constraints of the site. Their main role: a place conducive to meetings and exchanges. The project integrates through its green roof a direct link to the city. This place is part of the pedestrian continuity of public space arising from our axis from the quays of the Seine.

Shared gardens:                                                                                                                   
.increase the construction of social ties,                                                                                      
.bring an environmental reflection and transformation of the city,                                                                
.request the place of the inhabitants in the making of the city.


In my project I attach great importance to intermediate spaces which, in my opinion, provide a higher quality of uses and allow the inhabitants to experience architecture.
and enhance their transition from a common space to a private space. These devices are complementary to the housing, they form the extension of a private area of ​​the habitat to the outside. This is why in R + 1 we can see a common exterior gangway at +5 meters from the ground connecting the two accommodation buildings.

I ask myself the question of the evolution of the family structure. Through my homes I want to integrate the dimension of the room and more to allow mobility to family structures that change over time. For example, it involves designing an autonomous and independent space that can be separated from the rest of the apartment if necessary. We could imagine a family of 2 children in a typologie: T4 (3 bedrooms). Over time, the largest child moves to higher education. We can then offer the family the opportunity to resell this independent unit, to rent it to a third party, or to host an aging family member who must be looked after, while granting it some privacy, autonomy and independence.
